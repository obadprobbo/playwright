## Steps
 
1. Download and install Alcohol 120% from the official website[^5^] or from a trusted source. You can choose between a free version, a free trial version, or a paid version. The free version has some limitations, such as only allowing 6 virtual drives and not supporting Blu-ray discs. The free trial version has all the features of the paid version, but it expires after 15 days. The paid version costs $43 and offers lifetime updates and support.
2. Launch Alcohol 120% and click on the "Image Making Wizard" button on the main window. This will allow you to create an image file from a CD or DVD that you have inserted in your physical drive. Alternatively, you can skip this step if you already have an image file that you want to burn.
3. Select the source drive where your disc is located and click "Next". You can also adjust some settings, such as the read speed, the data type, and the error handling. Click "Next" again to choose the destination folder and the file name for your image file. You can also select the image format, such as .iso, .mds, .ccd, or .nrg. Click "Start" to begin the image making process.
4. Once the image file is created, you can either mount it on a virtual drive or burn it to a blank disc. To mount it on a virtual drive, click on the "Virtual Drive" button on the main window and select one of the available drives. Then click on the "Mount Image" button and browse for your image file. To burn it to a blank disc, click on the "Image Burning Wizard" button on the main window and select your image file. Then click "Next" to choose your target drive where your blank disc is inserted. You can also adjust some settings, such as the write speed, the number of copies, and the finalize option. Click "Start" to begin the burning process.
5. Wait for the process to finish and enjoy your burned CD or DVD.

## Tips

- You can also use Alcohol 120% to copy discs directly from one drive to another. To do this, click on the "Copy Wizard" button on the main window and select your source and target drives. Then follow the same steps as above.
- You can also use Alcohol 120% to erase rewritable discs. To do this, click on the "Erase Wizard" button on the main window and select your drive where your rewritable disc is inserted. Then choose either a quick erase or a full erase option and click "Start".
- You can also use Alcohol 120% to create audio CDs from your music files. To do this, click on the "Audio Converter" button on the main window and add your music files to the list.
